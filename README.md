# Classification-Life-Expectancy
Project aims to implement classification techniques using R libraries to classification of a dataset and then predictiong a training databased on the classifcation

Highlight of a Project:

1) Using life expectancy dataset from Wikepeda of each country
2) Implementation of classification methods like Support Vector Machines, K neaest neighbour, Random Forest Classification, Naive Bayes Classification, etc.
3) Computing accuracy through accuracy matrix and presenting it visually


Dataset : Life Expectancy Wikepedia
Programming Languages: R
